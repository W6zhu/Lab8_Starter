Graceful degradation is where a web application would still work even if part of it doesn't load or isn't supported by the browser or environment. Instead of completely breaking, it will still provide the user with a usuable experience. With service workers it make it possible as they run in the background of the browser and caches part of the site. Should the user come back with no connection it will still load the saved parts, thus allowing the app to still work with little to no connection.
